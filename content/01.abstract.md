## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Benchmarking is a critical step in the development of bioinformatics tools, but the way it is done at the moment has some limitations. Because each benchmark is developed in isolation, they tend to be hard to compare, extend and are rapidly outdated. To address this, we combined modern software development tools to create a workflow for continuous and collaborative benchmarking. The structure of the benchmark is highly modular, so that anyone can contribute a set of datasets, metrics, methods or interprete the results, and get credit for their input. We apply this worklow on two emerging types of methods in the single-cell analysis field: trajectory differential expression (https://github.com/komparo/tde) and trajectory alignment (https://github.com/komparo/ta).

## Outlook

The project as it stands now is meant to be a proof-of-concept. In the ideal case, a continuous benchmarking project should be supported by a larger consortium, such as the Human Cell Atlas, which would not only assure its continuity, but would also provide infrastructure support. Perhaps the code platform, continuous integration, and environment registry servers could be hosted by such as consortium. By providing a platform where old ideas are rigorously tested, and new ideas can be easily validated, 

A platform like this should be build upon the idea that future methods and output formats can never be predicted, but at least we can prepare for them.

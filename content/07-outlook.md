## Outlook

Continuous and collaborative benchmarking provides an alternative and powerful way to evaluate methods in computational biology. It relies heavily on modularisation and tools from software development, which make it possible to design a benchmarking strategy that can be easily extended by anyone, while still allowing for open discussion to exist in a field. Because less effort is spend developing new benchmarking workflows for every new method, this workflow would speed up method development in bioinformatics. Because the results of the benchmark can be easily interpreted by anyone, it would also avoid other issues such as the self-assessment trap [@doi:10.1038/msb.2011.70].

We created both a case study of the workflow [https://github.com/komparo/tde](https://github.com/komparo/tde), and a skeleton version which provides instructions on how to set up the workflow [https://github.com/komparo/tde](https://github.com/komparo/tde). Of course, as technologies and the communities building them come and go, the tools we used for this benchmark will almost certainly be replaced by more powerful tools soon. The crucial point is not which tools that are used, but what advantages they provide for the community: a portable environment, a reproducible workflow and a set of tools to collaboratively design a benchmark.

In the ideal case, a continuous benchmarking project should be supported by a larger consortium, such as the Human Cell Atlas, which would not only assure its continuity, but would also provide infrastructural support. In particular, services which have strong requirements on the side of storage and/or computing power would benefit from this, such as continuous integration, the code sharing platform and execution environment.

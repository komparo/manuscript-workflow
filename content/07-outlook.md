## Outlook

The project as it stands now is meant to be a proof-of-concept. Technologies, and the companies and communities building them, come and go, and the tools we used for this benchmark will almost certainly feel outdated in a couple of years. The crucial point is not which tools are used, but what advantages they provide for the community: a portable environment, a reproducible workflow, a way to collaboratively design a benchmark, and ultimately a more democratic view of the field and its challenges lying ahead.

In the ideal case, a continuous benchmarking project should be supported by a larger consortium, such as the Human Cell Atlas, which would not only assure its continuity, but would also provide infrastructure support. In particular, services which have strong requirements on the side of storage and/or computing power would benefit from this, such as continuous integration, the environment registry, and the execution cluster.

By providing a shared platform where old and current ideas are rigorously tested, and new ideas can be easily validated, 

A platform like this should be build upon the idea that future methods and output formats can never be predicted, but at least we can prepare for them.

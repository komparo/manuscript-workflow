    "abstract": "Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from\nthe diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a\nnew approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast.\nJulia questions notions generally held as \"laws of nature\" by practitioners of\nnumerical computing:\n  1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow.\n  2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language\nfor speed or deployment, and\n  3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left\nuntouched as they are built by the experts.\n  We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance\nbetween specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom\ntreatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the\nright algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation\nis really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are\nstripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another\ntechnique from computer science, generic programming.\n  Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human\nconvenience.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Pseudotime estimation from single-cell gene expression allows the recovery of temporal information from otherwise static profiles of individual cells. This pseudotemporal information can be used to characterise transient events in temporally evolving biological systems. Conventional algorithms typically emphasise an unsupervised transcriptome-wide approach and use retrospective analysis to evaluate the behaviour of individual genes. Here we introduce an orthogonal approach termed \"Ouija\" that learns pseudotimes from a small set of marker genes that might ordinarily be used to retrospectively confirm the accuracy of unsupervised pseudotime algorithms. Crucially, we model these genes in terms of switch-like or transient behaviour along the trajectory, allowing us to understand why the pseudotimes have been inferred and learn informative parameters about the behaviour of each gene. Since each gene is associated with a switch or peak time the genes are effectively ordered along with the cells, allowing each part of the trajectory to be understood in terms of the behaviour of certain genes. In the following we introduce our model and demonstrate that in many instances a small panel of marker genes can recover pseudotimes that are consistent with those obtained using the entire transcriptome. Furthermore, we show that our method can detect differences in the regulation timings between two genes and identify \"metastable\" states - discrete cell types along the continuous trajectories - that recapitulate known cell types. Ouija therefore provides a powerful complimentary approach to existing whole transcriptome based pseudotime estimation methods.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to profile the transcriptomes of a large number of individual cells at a high resolution. These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features: i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning: when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches - PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for scRNA-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.</jats:p>",
